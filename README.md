# Extensible Open Website Schema
The goal is to create a free and open schema or collection of schemas that can describe a website's structure and content unsuitable for other, broader content models. The schema(s) can be used as a standard data interchange format for migrating from one CMS to another or as a database schema for a website content repository like Sanity. This is necessary because the promise of a decoupled content management system cannot be realized if the site data structure differs from site to site or provider to provider.

One of the obvious challenges here is mapping from pages, posts, and blocks in a traditional Web CMS to an organization's content models.

## The schema should be:
* Able to fully describe a website's structure and content
* CMS and WebCMS agnostic
* Able to function as a data schema for headless CMS providers
* Extensible so that non-universal data structures can be added
* Be built on existing schema.org standards where appropriate

## This schema should be able to describe websites built with:
* Worpress
* Sitecore
* Joomla
* Drupal
* HubSpot
* Squarespace
* SAM

## This schema should be usable with content cloud providers such as:
* Sanity
* Others

## Other platforms that deserve exploration:
* GraphCMS
* Prismic
* Contentstack
* Butter CMS
* Kentico Kontent
* Directus
* Agility CMS
* Craft CMS
* Netlify CMS
* Contentful
* Strapi
* Storyblok
* Pyro
