# Extensible Open Website Schema
The goal is to create a free and open schema or collection of schemas that can be used to describe a website's structure and content. The schema(s) can be used as a standard data interchange format for migrating from one CMS to another or as a database schema for a website content repository like Sanity. This is necessary because the promise of a decoupled content management system cannot be realized if the data structure is different from site to site or provider to provider.

## The schema should be:
* Able to fully describe a website's structure and content
* CMS and WebCMS agnostic
* Able to function as a data schema for headless CMS providers
* Extensible so that non-universal data structures can be added
* Be built on existing schema.org standards where appropriate

## This schema should be able to fully describe websites built with:
* Worpress
* Sitecore
* Joomla
* Drupal
* HubSpot
* Squarespace
* SAM

## This schema should be usable with content cloud providers such as:
* Sanity
* Others

## Other platforms that deserve exploration:
* GraphCMS
* Prismic
* Contentstack
* Butter CMS
* Kentico Kontent
* Directus
* Agility CMS
* Craft CMS
* Netlify CMS
* Contentful
* Strapi
* Storyblok
* Pyro
